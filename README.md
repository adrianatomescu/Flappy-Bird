# Flappy-Bird

## Description
This version of the classic Flappy Bird game is developed using Unreal Engine 5 with blueprints.


## Getting Started
To start playing the game, follow these steps:

1. **Download the Game**: The game is distributed in three folders: **Assets**, **Game**, and **Launcher**. 
   
   - **Assets**: This folder contains all the assets used in the game, including the custom-made bird sprite created by me (made with Aseprite).
   - **Game**: Inside this folder, you'll find all the resources necessary for running the game in Unreal Engine.
   - **Launcher**: This folder contains the generated game launcher. To initiate the game, follow the steps below:
   
2. **Navigate to the Launcher Folder**: Locate the **Launcher** folder on your system.
3. **Select the Windows Folder**: Inside the **Launcher** folder, you'll find a folder named **Windows**. This is the platform-specific folder containing the game executable.
4. **Launch the Game**: Open the **Windows** folder and select the application named **FlappyGame** to start the game.


## How to Play
- **Right-click** to make the bird flap its wings and fly.
- Navigate through the gaps between pipes by timing your taps correctly.
- Make sure to steer clear of the pipes and the ground to keep the game going!
- Keep flying and try to achieve the highest score possible.
